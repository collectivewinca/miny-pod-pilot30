## 1. Kristen - Murder She Told
**To:** hello@murdershetold.com
**Subject:** Commemorating 100 episodes of Murder She Told

Hi Kristen,

I just finished your update on the Renee Freer case. The continued pressure you apply to these cases makes a real difference in keeping them active.

Congratulations on recently passing Episode 100! That's a massive achievement. I'm with MINY, and we help true crime podcasters create physical, collectible cards for their listeners. It's a way to turn a digital milestone into a tangible artifact that your 35,000 listeners can keep.

We'd love to help you launch a "Century Club" card to celebrate the 100-episode mark. It's a unique way to engage your audience without the headache of traditional merch logistics.

Here is a deck I made specifically for your show:

## 2. Benjamin - They Walk Among Us
**To:** info@theywalkamonguspodcast.com
**Subject:** A physical collection for 75K listeners

Hi Benjamin,

The recent episodes on the Moors Murders have been hauntingly well-produced. Your team's ability to handle such sensitive, high-profile cases with dignity sets the standard for the genre.

I'm reaching out because with Episode 300 on the horizon (about 10 weeks out), you have a great opportunity to offer something special to your 75,000 listeners. MINY creates NFC-enabled collectible cards—think of them as "vinyl records for podcasts."

They are perfect for a show with your production value. Fans can tap the card with their phone to unlock exclusive content or simply display the artwork as a collectible.

I've put together some ideas for Episode 300 here:

**Subject:** Something special for your 1,900+ Patreon supporters

Hi Mike,

I was listening to the Idaho College Murders coverage recently—solid, detailed work as always. You guys have built an incredible archive over the years.

I know you have a massive backlog (500+ episodes!) and a very dedicated Patreon base of nearly 2,000 supporters. At MINY, we create physical NFC cards that let superfans "own" their favorite episodes or milestones.

It's a fantastic way to reward your Patreon community with something tangible they can actually hold, bridging the gap between digital listening and physical collecting.

I'd love to show you how this could work for the TCATT community:

**Subject:** Celebrating the Wholigan community

Hi Bobby,

The recent segment on the Ashley Tisdale "Toxic Mom Group" drama had me dying. You and Lindsey have created such a specific, hilarious language for your listeners.

Speaking of which, your community is incredible—9,400+ on Patreon is no joke. I'm with MINY, and we create digital-physical collectibles (NFC cards) that are perfect for superfan communities like the Wholigans.

With Episode 1500 (!) coming up later this year, we could help you create a limited-edition collectible card. It's a fun, low-lift way to give your VIPs something exclusive to hold onto (literally).

## 5. Doug - Literature and History
**To:** literatureandhistoryguy@gmail.com
**Subject:** A physical archive for the Rashidun Caliphate

Hi Doug,

I was just listening to your deep dive on the Rashidun Caliphate (Episode 120)—the way you contextualize such massive historical shifts is always impressive.

I'm reaching out because a library as dense and well-researched as yours deserves to be preserved physically. At MINY, we create NFC-enabled collectible cards that turn your episodes into physical artifacts listeners can collect and display. It's like a trading card for the digital age, but with your audio embedded directly inside.

With Episode 125 approaching in just a few weeks, we'd love to help you launch a limited edition "milestone card" for your 75,000+ listeners. We handle all the production and logistics, so you can focus on the research and writing.

I've put together a mock-up of what a Literature and History card could look like here:

**Subject:** A meaningful way to honor the stories you tell

Hi Laurah,

I've been following your recent coverage on the shifts in forensic IGG. The way The Fall Line advocates for victims and keeps these cold cases in the light is truly essential work.

I'm reaching out because we've built something at MINY designed to help mission-driven shows like yours create deeper connections. We produce beautiful, physical NFC cards that listeners can hold—a respectful way to honor the stories you tell and the victims you advocate for.

With Episode 250 approaching, this could be a powerful way for your 30,000 listeners to support the show's mission physically. We handle everything, ensuring the tone and presentation are perfect.

**Subject:** Celebrating Episode 250 with the Cripescast community

Hi Charlie,

Loved the recent chat with Craig T. Nelson—especially the bits about Green and Gold. You've built such a distinct, welcoming vibe with the show that really resonates.

I'm writing because I see you're coming up on a huge milestone—Episode 250 is just a few weeks away. At MINY, we help creators celebrate moments like this by turning episodes into collectible NFC cards. It's a way for your merch-buying fans (and your 30k listeners) to actually "own" a piece of the show's history.

We'd love to help you launch a special Episode 250 commemorative card. It requires zero inventory risk on your end and gives your community a tangible keepsake to mark the occasion.

Here is a quick look at how it works:

**Subject:** A Gallic Sack of Rome... in your pocket?

Hi Dr. Radford,

I really enjoyed Part 2 of the Gallic Sack of Rome. The detail you both go into really brings the chaos of that era to life.

I'm writing because your academic approach creates the kind of content that listeners want to keep. At MINY, we turn podcast episodes into physical, NFC-enabled cards. It allows your 30,000 listeners to build a physical library of your history lessons.

With Episode 200 coming up in about 5 weeks, it would be the perfect time to release a commemorative card. We handle all the manufacturing and shipping, so you can stay focused on the history.

I've mocked up a concept for you here:

**To:** info@workingclasshistory.com
**Subject:** A physical archive for people's history

Hi John,

The recent episode on the Anti-Poll Tax movement was a great listen—vital context for understanding grassroots resistance.

I'm contacting you because Working Class History isn't just a podcast; it's an archive. At MINY, we help mission-driven projects preserve their work through physical NFC cards. It allows your supporters to "own" a piece of this history.

With Episode 150 approaching, we could help you launch a supporter card for your ~1,000 Patreon backers. It's a way to strengthen that community connection and offer a physical token of their support for the project.
