## 1. MURDER, SHE TOLD (Kristen Seavey)

### Variation A: Emotional/Victim Advocacy

**Subject:** A meaningful way to honor the stories you tell

Hi Kristen,

I've been following Murder, She Told and your recent episode on the unsolved murder of Scott Sampson really stayed with me—the image of a 26-year-old father of two lying undiscovered for hours still haunts me 35 years later.

Your podcast gives voice to victims and families still searching for answers. What if your listeners could hold a piece of that legacy?

MINY PODS creates NFC-enabled collectible cards for milestone episodes—physical keepsakes fans can treasure, tap to access exclusive content, and display as meaningful reminders of stories that matter.

For your upcoming Episode 100 milestone, these cards could honor the victims you've covered and deepen your community's connection to the stories.

Would a quick 15-minute call work to explore this?
