## Doug - Literature and History

Subject: Rashidun Caliphate episode + MINY for Ep 125

Hi Doug,

I was just listening to your recent deep dive on the Rashidun Caliphate—the way you contextualized the rapid expansion really helped clarify that era for me. The detail you bring to these historical narratives is incredible, and I'm really looking forward to what you have planned for Episode 125 in a few weeks.

I'm reaching out from MINY because we're piloting a new way for history podcasters to create digital collectibles that actually have utility. We think your audience would love a way to "own" a piece of the show, especially for a milestone like Ep 125.

Our platform lets you issue secure, digital assets that can unlock bonus content or just serve as a badge of fandom. It's a great way to deepen engagement without just asking for Patreon support. I'd love to show you how it works.

Best,

## Charlie - The Cripescast

Subject: Go Pack Go + Ep 250 ideas

Hi Charlie,

I caught the recent episode about Craig T. Nelson and, naturally, the Green and Gold discussion. As always, the "Keep 'er Movin'" energy is exactly what I needed this week. I see you've got Episode 250 coming up in about three weeks—congrats on the milestone!

I wanted to introduce you to MINY. We're building a tool for creators like you to offer digital collectibles that feel authentic to your community. We think a "Cripescast" collectible for the 250th episode would be a fun way for fans to celebrate with you.

It's not just a jpeg; these assets can unlock exclusive content or community perks. It feels very in line with the community-focused vibe of the Midwest. Would love to chat about it briefly.

Best,

## Laurah - The Fall Line

Subject: Forensic IGG & supporting The Fall Line

Hi Laurah,

The work you're doing on The Fall Line, especially the recent coverage on Forensic IGG, is so vital. It’s amazing to see how technology is finally catching up to these cold cases. I noticed you're approaching Episode 250 in a month—that is a huge achievement in this space.

I'm with MINY, and we're exploring how true crime podcasts can use digital collectibles to drive advocacy and support. Imagine a collectible that doesn't just sit there but actually helps fund research or unlocks deep-dive case files for your most dedicated listeners.

We'd love to help you launch something special for Episode 250. It’s a low-lift way to engage your audience and potentially raise more funds for the causes you highlight.

Best,

## Kristen - Murder She Told

Subject: Renee Freer case & Ep 100

Hi Kristen,

I just finished the episode on the Renee Freer case. The way you handle these stories with such empathy and local focus really sets Murder She Told apart. Congrats on hitting Episode 100 recently—that's a massive milestone!

I’m writing to you from MINY. We help podcasters create digital collectibles that offer real utility to listeners. For a show like yours, this could mean offering a commemorative token for Ep 100 that grants access to an exclusive Q&A or behind-the-scenes notes.

It’s a new way to build community value without relying solely on traditional merch or ads. I’d love to walk you through how it could work for your audience.

## Benjamin - They Walk Among Us

Subject: Moors Murders revisited + Ep 300

Hi Benjamin,

I've been a long-time listener of They Walk Among Us. Your recent coverage of the Moors Murders was chilling and incredibly well-researched, as always. I see you're tracking towards Episode 300 in about ten weeks—an incredible run for the show.

I wanted to put MINY on your radar. We're a platform for digital collectibles that do more than just sit in a wallet. We think there's a unique opportunity for True Crime podcasts to offer listeners a way to collect "evidence" or case files digitally, enhancing the storytelling experience.

For your 300th episode, we could create a limited edition drop for your loyal listeners. It’s simple to set up and adds a new layer of interaction to the podcast.

## Mike - True Crime All The Time

Subject: Idaho College Murders & 500 Episodes!

Hi Mike,

I was listening to your take on the Idaho College Murders recently—always appreciate the "everyman" perspective you guys bring to these heavy cases. I know you recently passed the 500-episode mark (wow!), and I wanted to reach out.

I’m with MINY, and we’re helping top-tier podcasts launch digital collectibles. We think TCATT fans would get a kick out of owning a piece of the show's history, especially celebrating such a huge catalog of episodes.

These collectibles can be used to reward long-time listeners with exclusive audio or merch discounts. It’s a modern way to say thanks to the fans who have stuck with you for 500 episodes.

## Bobby - Who? Weekly

Subject: Ashley Tisdale, Toxic Moms, and Wholigan utility

Hi Bobby,

Long-time Wholigan here. The segment on Ashley Tisdale and the "Toxic Mom" energy had me dying. I know Episode 1500 (!) is a long way off (next year?), but you guys churn out content like machines, so I figured I'd reach out early.

I’m working with MINY, a platform for digital collectibles with actual utility. We think Who? Weekly is perfect for this—imagine a "Wholigan" card that verifies you as a top-tier patron or grants access to specific live show presales.

It fits perfectly with the inside-joke culture of the podcast. We'd love to help you design something fun and "Who"-y for the community.

Best,

## Fiona - The Partial Historians

Subject: Gallic Sack of Rome & Ep 200

Hi Fiona,

I was revisiting the Gallic Sack of Rome episode recently—I love the banter and the deep historical analysis you and Dr. Rad bring. I noticed you are approaching Episode 200 in about five weeks. That is a serious milestone for ancient history podcasting!

I’m reaching out from MINY. We help creators issue digital collectibles that have real-world or digital utility. For The Partial Historians, this could be a "Roman Citizen" token that unlocks bonus episodes or voting rights on future topics.

It’s a great way to celebrate Episode 200 and give something lasting to your listeners. I'd be happy to show you a demo of how it works.

## Andrew - We Hate Movies

Subject: Family Plan 2 Roast & Ep 1250

Hi Andrew,

I was crying laughing at the roast of The Family Plan 2. You guys haven't lost a step. I know Episode 1250 is a bit down the road (36 weeks or so), but I wanted to connect now.

I’m with MINY, and we're building a platform for digital collectibles that actually do stuff. For a comedy podcast like WHM, the possibilities are hilarious—maybe a "Secundus" token that unlocks the worst movies you've ever reviewed, or specific soundboard access.

We think your fanbase would eat this up. It’s a fun, low-risk way to add value to the Patreon tiers or just sell directly. Would love to chat.

## John - Working Class History

Subject: Anti-Poll Tax Movement & Digital Solidarity

Hi John,

The episode on the Anti-Poll Tax Movement was incredibly powerful. It’s important history that often gets glossed over. I see you have Episode 150 coming up in about six months.

I’m contacting you from MINY. We’re working on a way for educational and historical projects to use digital collectibles for fundraising and awareness. A "Working Class History" collectible could serve as a permanent badge of solidarity for your supporters, unlocking extended interviews or archival photos.

It’s a modern tool for a project rooted in history. We'd love to discuss how this could support your mission for Ep 150 and beyond.
